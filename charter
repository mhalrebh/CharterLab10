<Group 801/901>


1. Availability for meeting expectations
2. Response time to communication expectations
3. Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)

For a task to be done, the group member has to fully complete the task. This includes creating a full set of tests before
starting the project to make sure it's functioning properly and to submit it to github. The work has to be done on time
or it will not count as done (ie late submissions) unless agreed upon by the other team members beforehand. and Lastly,
the code has to do what it's supposed to do.

4. Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)

For scrum meetings, we should meet at least once a week. Depending on how light or heavy the workload is, new meetings may be added or removed.
Days and time at which we will be meeting weekly will be discussed when all the group members are here. The times should not be changed for
consistency purposes.

if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here
Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations
must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor
Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the document.
